This project is in progress and very unstable yet.

# Enhanced Keyboard Shortcut Management for Blender

## Overview
The Blender Shortcut Organizer is a user-centric project aimed at streamlining the keyboard shortcut experience within Blender. It addresses some inefficiencies in navigating and customizing Blender's keyboard shortcuts. This project serves as a showcase for an intuitive and user-friendly approach to shortcut management.

## Short Term Goals

- **Comprehensive Listing of Shortcuts**: Provides a easy-to read searchable list of all keyboard shortcuts, making it easier for users to find and learn about available commands.
  
- **Simplified Shortcut Assignment**: Introduces a more straightforward method for assigning keyboard shortcuts to functions, particularly those that are not readily accessible through the default UI.
  
## Long Term Plans

- **Shortcut Suggestions**: Live-analyzes user behavior and timely-suggest use of available or new shortcuts for frequently used operations, thereby optimizing the user's workflow. "You can do what you just did by pressing xxx".

- **Recent Operations Tracking**: Create a feature that keeps a log of recent operations, allowing users to quickly assign shortcuts to their most recent actions.
  
- **RPG style turorials**: To help user remember selection of shortcuts based on what the user plan to do should serve as interactive tutorials. relevant explanation texts/sample data can also be programatically provided.  Like tutorials in RPGs, this would present easy to walk path to exploer ever-growing dungeon of blender functionalities.
  
## Long-Term Vision

The current implementation in Python serves as a prototype for demonstrating the concept and gathering user feedback. The ultimate goal is to refine the addon to a level of stability and efficiency that it can be considered for integration into Blender's core functionality, potentially as a C++ branch. This approach not only facilitates rapid development and iteration but also allows for broader community engagement and contribution.
